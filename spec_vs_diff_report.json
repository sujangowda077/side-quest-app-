  "summary": "Diff adds a new single-page landing composition (App.tsx) with navbar, hero video, watermark, sections, CTAs, scroll progress, and footer. Several spec mismatches remain: Campus Buzz item text/emojis, Real App Experience copy/layout/assets, final CTA button label, and hero video lazy-load behavior. Also introduces unrequested third-party icon libraries and edits/adds files in immutablePaths.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Use the user-provided real screenshots inside phone mockups with the provided headlines/paragraphs appearing verbatim, and screenshots displayed within phone mockups using the provided phone mockup frame asset.",
      "reason": "The section exists and alternates layout for the first two blocks, but the copy shown is not guaranteed/verbatim (and includes non-goal copy about UPI/OTP), and the phone frame asset is not used (mockup uses a simple border overlay rather than the provided phone-mockup-frame image).",

      "requirement": "Campus Buzz Preview feed must display the three specified items verbatim including emojis: “🔥 50% off after 4 PM”, “📢 Print shop closing at 7 PM”, “🎉 Free fries with combo meal”.",
      "reason": "Feed texts omit the required leading emojis and therefore are not verbatim.",

      "requirement": "Lazy-load the hero video (not eagerly blocking initial render) and show fallback image if video fails/cannot autoplay.",
      "reason": "Fallback image handling exists via `poster` and `videoError`, but there is no clear evidence of lazy-loading behavior (e.g., `preload=\"none\"`, intersection-based loading, or conditional source attachment). The component also calls `video.play()` immediately on mount.",
